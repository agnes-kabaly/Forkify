# Forkify

This is a recipe searching app where 

## you can:
 
- search food recipes,
- read them,
- change their serving sizes, which changes their amount of ingredients,
- add ingredients to a shopping list,
- delete ingredients, or
- change amount of ingredients,
- add recipes to a like list (which store them).


I built this project in The Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy taught by Jonas Schmedtmann. It's using the food2fork API recover recipes.

The project focusing on writing JavaScript (ES6).
